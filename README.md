# Object Detector 🕵️‍♂️

Object Detector is an Android application that uses TensorFlow Lite for real-time object detection. Using Jetpack Compose for UI and MVVM architecture, the app efficiently processes camera input to recognize various objects.

The app loads a TensorFlow Lite model and analyzes live camera feed data, detecting objects in real-time and displaying the results.

## Architecture 🏗

The app follows the MVVM architecture:
- **Model**: Handles TensorFlow Lite model operations.
- **ViewModel**: Provides data to the UI.
- **View**: Jetpack Compose-based UI, displaying camera feed and detection results.

## Usage 📲

1. Clone the repo and open it in Android Studio.
2. Configure your TensorFlow Lite model and paths.
3. Build and deploy the app on a compatible Android device.
